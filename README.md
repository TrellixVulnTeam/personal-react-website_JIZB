# React Image Demo Kevin Ahl
This an infinitly loading image grid with lightbox view that has a magnifying tool.
There is a search that will auto update the search when you finish typing.

This example uses:
<li> React </li>
<li> Webpack </li>
<li> Yarn </li>
<li> react-query </li>
<li> Axios </li>
<li> Sass </li>
<li> Other smaller libraries </li>
<br>
Notes: 
<br>Im using the pixabay photo api.
<br> The sorting only sorts within the pages, which are 12 images in a row, this is due to the infinite loading feature, ive included it anyways to show that I can do it.

### The app is hosted on vercel and you can view it at:<br> <a>https://react-image-demo-reel-good.vercel.app</a>

Thanks for your time!
